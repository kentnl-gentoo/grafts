rlslist format:

<timestamp from pause submission> <fetch URL> <sha1>*

With row 0:

- No SHA1's mean "start without any parents"
- 1-or-more SHA1's dictate a list of parents to use for that commit.

With Row 1 (or greater):

- The previous row is assumed to be the first parent
- additonal SHA1's are additonal parents.

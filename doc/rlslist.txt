rlslist format:

<timestamp from pause submission> <fetch URL> <sha1>*

With row 0:

- No SHA1's mean "start without any parents"
- 1-or-more SHA1's dictate a list of parents to use for that commit.

With Row 1 (or greater):

- The previous row is assumed to be the first parent
- additonal SHA1's are additonal parents.

Note: timestamps are currently ignored by grafting tool, which instead
prefers to use the archive-internal timestamp of the newest node, which is
usually closer to the respective source commit timestamp than the PAUSE one,
and is typically less subject to clock desynchronization issues, as the
author producing the commit and the tarball are *usually* the same person,
and the single machine's clock tends to get used as the authority on both the
commit timestamp and the file-in-tarball timestamp (whereas the users machine
and PAUSE can easily be days, months, or even years apart)
